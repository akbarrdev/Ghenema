### Prerequisites

Before beginning the setup process, ensure all server requirements are met:

1. Virtual Machine (Windows recommended due to broader source compatibility)
2. GTPS source (commonly referred to as CPP, though it may be written in various programming languages)
3. HTTPS Server (to establish connections and route clients to the server)

### Setup Instructions

1. Log in to your Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) instance.

2. Download and install necessary software, including:
   - Google Chrome
   - WinRAR
   - Visual Studio
   - Other relevant tools

3. Configure the firewall:
   - Set up inbound rules to allow access on port 443 (HTTPS)
   - Enable a custom UDP port for public access (e.g., port 17091)
   Note: If you need assistance with this step, consult an experienced another server owner.

4. Properly configure and launch your HTTPS server.

5. Configure your GTPS source code and execute it by running the corresponding executable file (e.g., server_name.exe).

### Post-Setup Recommendations

To improve and maintain your server:

- Implement engaging features
- Address and resolve emerging bugs
- Listen to user feedback and implement viable suggestions
- Continuously explore ways to enhance and advance your server

Remember to stay updated with the latest security practices and regularly backup your data to ensure a smooth and secure server operation.
