# GTPS Knowledge Base for Ghenema AI Bot

Welcome to the Growtopia Private Server (GTPS) Knowledge Base repository! This project aims to collect and organize information about GTPS to create a comprehensive dataset for our AI bot, "GTPS Helper That Never Mad" (Ghenema). [Try Ghenema in Nipon Community!](https://discord.gg/p8nN8J6tMz).

## About This Project

This knowledge base serves as a collaborative platform for the GTPS community to contribute their expertise and knowledge. The collected information will be used to train and improve Ghenema, an AI bot designed to assist GTPS players and server administrators.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:
1. To gather diverse knowledge about GTPS from the community
2. To create a structured dataset for training Ghenema AI bot
3. To provide a reliable and up-to-date source of information for the GTPS community
4. To reduce frustration within the community by providing a patient, always-available source of information

## Why Ghenema?

In the GTPS community, we often encounter players asking basic questions without first attempting to find the answers themselves. This can lead to frustration among more experienced members, sometimes resulting in harsh responses or even bullying.

Ghenema AI bot is designed to address this issue by providing a friendly, patient, and always-available resource for answering questions. Our goal is to create a more welcoming environment where everyone can learn and get help without fear of negative reactions.
